## 🏗 Engineering Philosophy

I design data systems with a structured, production-oriented mindset.

My focus is not just writing scripts — but building:

- Reliable ETL pipelines
- Business-aligned data transformations
- Scalable data architecture patterns
- Lakehouse & Warehouse simulations
- Modular, maintainable data systems

I am currently building a portfolio of real-world data engineering use cases to strengthen architectural thinking.
